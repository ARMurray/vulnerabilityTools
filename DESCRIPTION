Description: This is a package designed to contain helper functions used in the creation of the National Groundwater Vulnerability Index for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Many of the functions are planned to be based around managing the SSURGO dataset from USDA within R. There will also be functions for managing SMAP data for soil moisture.
